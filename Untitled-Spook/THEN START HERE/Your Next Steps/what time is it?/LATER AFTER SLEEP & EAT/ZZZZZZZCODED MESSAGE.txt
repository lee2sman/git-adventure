INCOMING SIGNAL FROM JRVXS

Hello Agent.

---zzzzzz------oeuchrou00293203209signed-%((3

Your mission is twofold. Find the enemy spook station. A little-known broadcasting rig hidden in C-Dex Domain, likely in a rural outpost in the uRal mountainrange. You must use your skills to sniff out the signal..roozzzooooreeeu....zzzzz......oreucroecuh%(@).....

Secondly, neutralize enemy droners in the city of San Lazino. Without the spook station, they will function autonomously. You'll have to find them, heavily armed though they may be, and disconnect, direct or otherwise end their functioning. 

Please confirm receipt of message. ....zzzooro00930$$$*(##
