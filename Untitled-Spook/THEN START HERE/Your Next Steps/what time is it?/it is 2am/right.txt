that is a perfectly good time to do anything. you could go to bed or write a book or listen to quiet music. maybe there is someone asleep in the room next to you. you are reading or writing quietly so you don't wake them up. the fan is on or not. the moon is out. you can't see it. but you can feel it out there. the air is still. you can feel the world around you.
