is this the witching hour. or is it midnight? in another time, a parallel future, you are coming home at 5am on a motorbike in the tiny fast streets of new saigon. you ate noodles, a soup, pho in fact, in a street food cart, and now you are putt putting home. after 20 minutes zig zagging around the city, heading home to bed (your friend's home you are staying in), you are at the end of your street (your friend's street), and you can't wait for bed, to go to sleep, so soon - but you see people waking up, walking out into the street, lighting coals to heat their own soup, for they are waking up for the day, before you go to bed for the night, and they are starting their breakfast soup. you had a girlfriend who would have thought this was success, being out all night, enjoying the night. you didn't think so, but now you aren't sure. maybe she was right.
