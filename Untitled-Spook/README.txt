VERSION 1.1
UPDATED 9.30.2015

WARNING: THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL SCI-FY GAME-POEM-FILESYSTEM THING. 

It is inspired by folder-poem game Foldscape by Porpentine.

YOU WILL TAKE UP AN IDENTITY IN THE PARALLEL FUTURE

REQUIREMENTS:
-Any computer
-An Application that can open a text file such as Word, TextEdit, Wordpad, etc
-An Application that can play an mp3 file

HOW TO PLAY:
-Open text files and read them. You will navigate through folders and files to move forward through the story.
When prompted, you can type an X, or delete something, or save a file. When you finish reading each text file, just quit it. You can save if you want. (Note: It is recommended to open the actual text files instead of just reading them in the preview so that you can properly get the layout of the ASCII text).

Move through folders, reading and navigating and finding your way.

It should take about 10-15 minutes.


THANK YOU.
